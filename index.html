      <h2>What are colloquia?</h2>
      <p>
        A “colloquium” is a literary form that reached its height in the Renaissance period. Each colloquium is a very
        short play or dialogue, usually only a few pages long. Most commonly colloquia were written for pedagogical
        purposes, intended to teach Latin, a moral lesson, or both. <br><br>

        Erasmus and other capable neo-Latinists wrote a large number of colloquia. These provide a delightful source of
        high quality yet approachable Latinity in digestible chunks. They are of particular interest for anyone who
        wishes
        to speak Latin actively, as they provide excellent, useful examples of every-day conversations.<br><br>

        Colloquia can be enjoyed through solo reading, performed in a group, memorized, used as writing prompts, filmed
        for short videos, etc. See this page for tips on profitably using colloquia as a student or teacher.

      <h2>Where do these Colloquia come from?</h2>
      <p>
        The colloquia on this site are all collected from works in the public domain. We owe a debt of gratitude to ___
        and the __ project at the University of Kentucky, who first started the collection and digital transcription of
        colloquia. Unfortunately, after __’s death and subsequent migration updates to the Perseus website, those
        colloquia were not easily available online. Additionally, they had never been formatted in a manner conducive to
        enjoyable reading.<br><br>

        We have also sourced colloquia from X and Y.

      <h2>Where do I start?</h2>
      <p>
        The list of colloquia can be a bit overwhelming. Luckily, you could pick one at random and be fine. On this site
        you can search by author if you happen to be intrigued by a particular author.<br><br>

        Eventually we plan to add topic and difficulty tags to the colloquia, so you could find only colloquia having to
        do with schoolwork or only easy colloquia.<br><br>

        We also have plans to produce in book form a florelogium (curated collection) of colloquia well suited for
        students of Latin who are first dipping their toes into the world of colloquia.

        This website and its contents are a labor of love, a somewhat perverse love for the Latin language and
        especially
        active Latin.<br><br>
