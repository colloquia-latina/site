        <h2>What are colloquia?</h2>
        <p>
          A “colloquium” is a dialogue, with or without a parallel translation,
          that has been a common feature in language classrooms since the
          Babylonians. They are usually written with a self-contained story and aim 
          to provide an enjoyable exercise in grammar and vocab 
          and a model for daily speech. In the Latin classroom, these
          have been a regular feature since the late empire, when Greek-speakers
          used them to practice their Latin--and vice versa. <br /><br />

          Some of the finest and most interesting colloquia were written by
          Humanists on both sides of the Reformation: men like Erasmus,
          Corderius, and Castalio. They modeled high-level Latin speech while
          still conciously writing for students. Today, these can be used for
          solo reading, group reading, memorization, writing prompts, and even
          short skits. They are a particularly valuable resource for those using
          Latin actively, as they provide a model for applying classical models
          to new occasions.

        <h2>Where do these Colloquia come from?</h2>
        <p>
          The colloquia on this site are all collected from works in the public
          domain. We owe a debt of gratitude to Ross Scaife, Terence Tunberg,
          and Milena Minkova at the University of Kentucky, who with other
          professors and students arranged for the digitization and online
          hosting of a number of neo-Latin colloquia. Unfortunately, after Ross
          Scaife’s death and subsequent migration updates to the Perseus
          website, those colloquia were only available through Internet Archive.
          Thanks to Christopher Francese at Dickinson College, the text for
          those particular colloquia has been made again available. They are presented 
          here with improved formatting, macrons, and additional notes on 
          a more stable and accessible hosting platform. <br /><br />

          Eventually we hope to host our source text files in our
          <a href="/archive-list/">Archive right here.</a>

        <p>
          The list of colloquia can be a bit overwhelming. The most famous
          Colloquia are those written by Erasmus, but these are hardly the only
          ones. To help you, we've tagged colloquia by author, topic, and
          difficulty level to help you better find what you're looking for.

          This website and its contents are published by Jackson Perry and Jacob
          Terneus. This is a labor of love for the Latin language and especially
          active Latin. <br /><br />

          Many colloquia still need to be transcribed before they can be
          published on this site. <br /><br />
